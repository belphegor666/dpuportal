        <h3>The challenge</h3>
        <p>Staff joining an organisation under TUPE (Transfer of Undertakings, Protection of Employment ) must have their terms and
          conditions carefully managed to ensure both legal and business rule compliance.
          The current approach is labour intensive, manual only, imprecise and requires HR experts for all activities.
        </p>
        <h3>The answer</h3>
        <p>Create a prototype to see how (and if) a Digital model could enhance the way that Terms and Conditions are managed.</p>

        <h3>Key business challenges:</h3>
        <p> - Minimise legal risk due to mishandling of employee Terms and Conditions</p>
        <p> - Role-based access to menus and content</p>
        <p> - Make Key Terms and Conditions information easily available</p>
        <p> - Test and api - Terms and Conditions as a service</p>
        <p> - Reduction in cost of the HR Terms and Conditions processes</p>
        <p> - Opportunity to collaborate with other departments and organisations during transitions</p>
