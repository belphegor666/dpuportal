        <h3>The challenge</h3>

        <p>How can we innovate policing to make the Notting Hill Carnival a safer event where people can have fun and
          the police
          can develop its community links.</p>

        <h3>The answer</h3>

        <p>Using Digital Technologies, we can keep people <strong>Informed, Aware, Empowered and Protected</strong></p>

        <h3>Working with the community</h3>

        <p>The app allows people to monitor what is happening at the Carnival and report incidents. </p>

        <p>When an incident is reported: <br><i class="icon-ok"></i>The location on the map where the incident took
          place is entered from
          the device or manually.<br>
          <i class="btn-sm glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></i>Events are categorised, different incident types to be colour coded on the map<br>
          <i class="btn-sm glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></i>Status can be tracked: reported, confirmed, closed, ongoing

        <p align="center">The app can be used to get people involved with supporting a safe and enjoyable carnival.</p>

        <p>The vast majority of people want to attend the event to have fun and be entertained. The app will allow
          people to:<br>
          <i class="btn-sm glyphicon glyphicon-ok" ></i> Get involved in the event in advance.<br>
          <i class="btn-sm glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></i> Contribute to a safe event.<br>
          <i class="btn-sm glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></i> Discourage criminal activity.
        </p>

        <p>It is well known that the greatest deterrent of crime is a high likelihood of detection.
          If the community are able to contribute to the policing of the event, then the high probability of detection
          should lead to a more enjoyable event for all and lower crime rates.
